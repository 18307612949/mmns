SQLite Extensions

	Because sqlite only provides a small subset of functions, to do some
	higher level mathematics, I needed to include more.

	For example, it's pretty difficult to compute a distance in multiple
	dimensions without a 'sqrt()' function.

	Needless to say, all of the extensions are located in extensions.c,
	and the shared library is located within bin when the program has
	been fully built.

	Here's the list of extensions:
		sqrt()
			Uses math.h's sqrt() function to compute a number's sqrt in SQL.

			Returns
				REAL

			Ex.
				> SELECT sqrt(9);
				> 3.0
