# Multi-Machine-Network-System

#### Or, MMNS for short

## What is this MMNS thing that you've made

Quite simply, this project aims to become an interactive load-balancer. Load
balancers like [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) exist, and the market has
a couple that exist, but they behave much like Computing Associate's CA-7
product for IBM mainframes, in that a human schedules up a series of batch
jobs, and the load balancing system in between behaves like
[GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/), and simply takes your
command/scipt, and pushes it to however many computers you tell it to run on.
